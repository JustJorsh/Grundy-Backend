# Grundy Backend

Nigeria’s e-commerce sector is rapidly evolving, driven by mobile adoption, fintech innovation, and the growing demand for convenience. Grocery shopping, however, remains fragmented — dominated by open-air markets, mom and pop shops, supermarkets and informal retail.

Grundy LLC is a Nigerian startup aiming to bridge this gap. The company provides a marketplace app that connects open-air markets and grocery shops to customers, with last-mile fulfillment handled by delivery riders.
